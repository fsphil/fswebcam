This is the program used to generate images for a webcam. It captures a number
of frames from any V4L or V4L2 compatible device, averages them to reduce noise
and draws the details on it using the GD Graphics Library which also handles
compressing the image to PNG, JPEG or WEBP.

INSTALLING

Run the following commands in the source folder to build and install fswebcam:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

It's only requirements are that the GD library be installed with JPEG, PNG
and FreeType support.
