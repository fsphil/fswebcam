.SH NAME
fswebcam \- Small and simple webcam for *nix.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fswebcam
[\fI<options>\fR] \fI<filename>\fR [[\fI<options>\fR] \fI<filename>\fR ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
fswebcam is a small and simple webcam app for *nix. It can capture images from a number of different sources and perform simple manipulation on the captured image. The image can be saved as one or more PNG, JPEG or WEBP files.
.PP
The image can be sent to stdio using the filename "\-". The output filename is formatted by \fBstrftime\fR.

.SH CONFIGURATION

.SS
Configuration File

.TP
Config files use the long version of options without the "\-\-" prefix. Comments start with a # symbol at the beginning of the line.

.SS
General Options

.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show a usage summary.

.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR
Load options from a file. You can load more than one config file, and can mix them with command\-line arguments.

Note: This option can not be used from within a configuration file.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Hides all messages except errors.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print extra information during the capture process.

.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number and exit.

.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-loop\fR \fI<frequency>\fR
Continually capture images. The time between images is specified in seconds.
.IP
Default behaviour is to capture a single image and exit.
.IP
\fINote\fR: The time to capture the next image is calculated relative to the epoch, so an image will not be captured immediately when the program is first started.

.TP
\fB\-\-offset\fR \fI<seconds>\fR
Sets the offset to use when calculating when the next image is due in loop mode. Value can be positive or negative.

.TP
\fB\-\-count\fR \fI<number>\fR
Sets the number of times to capture an image in loop mode before exiting.
.IP
Default is 0, loop forever.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-background\fR
Run in the background. In this mode \fIstdout\fR and console logging are unavailable.

.TP
\fB\-\-pid\fR \fI<filename>\fR
Saves the PID of the background process to the specified file. Ignored when not using background mode.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR \fI[file/syslog:]<filename>\fR
Redirect log messages to a file or syslog. For example
.IP
\-\-log output.log
.br
\-\-log file:output.log
.br

\fB\-\-gmt\fR
Use GMT instead of the local timezone when formatting text with \fBstrftime\fR.

.SS
Capture Options

.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-device\fR \fI[<prefix>:]<device name>\fR
Set the source or device to use. The source module is selected automatically unless specified in the prefix.
.IP
Default is \fI/dev/video0\fR.
.IP

.IP
V4L2 \- Capture images from a V4L2 compatible video device.
.br
V4L1 \- Capture images from a V4L1 compatible video device.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-resolution\fR \fI<dimensions>\fR
Set the image resolution of the source or device. The actual resolution used may differ if the source or device cannot capture at the specified resolution.
.IP
Default is "384x288".

.TP
\fB\-\-fps\fR \fI<frames per second>\fR
Sets the frame rate of the capture device. This currently only works with certain V4L2 devices.
.IP
Default is "0", let the device decide.

.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-frames\fR \fI<number>\fR
Set the number of frames to capture. More frames mean less noise in the final image, however capture times will be longer and moving objects may appear blurred.
.IP
Default is "1".

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-skip\fR \fI<number>\fR
Set the number of frames to skip. These frames will be captured but won't be use. Use this option if your camera sends some bad or corrupt frames when it first starts capturing.
.IP
Default is "0".

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delay\fR \fI<delay>\fR
Inserts a delay after the source or device has been opened and initialised, and before the capture begins. Some devices need this delay to let the image settle after a setting has changed. The delay time is specified in seconds.

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR \fI<seconds>\fR
Adjusts the timeout period in seconds for frame capture. This should be increased for exposures longer than 10 seconds.
.IP
Default is "10".

.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-read\fR
Use read() to capture images. This can be slower but more stable with some devices.
.IP
Default is to use mmap(), falling back on read() if mmap() is unavailable.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-set\fR \fI<name=value>\fI
Set a control. These are used by the source modules to control image or device parameters. Numeric values can be expressed as a percentage of there maximum range or a literal value, for example:
.IP
\-\-set brightness=50%
\-\-set framerate=5
.IP
Non\-numeric controls are also supported:
.IP
\-\-set lights=on
.IP
V4L2 features a type of control called a 'button'. These controls do not take any value, but trigger an action. For example:
.IP
\-\-set "Restore Factory Settings"
.IP
Control names and values are not case sensitive.
.IP
\fINote\fR: Available controls will vary depending in the source module and devices used. For more information see the \fB\-\-list\-controls\fR option.

.TP
\fB\-\-list\-controls\fR
List available controls and their current values for the selected source module and device. For example:
.IP
fswebcam \-d v4l2:/dev/video2 \-\-list\-controls

.SS
Output Options

.TP
These options are performed in the order they appear on the command line, only effecting images output later on the command line. For example:
.IP
fswebcam \-r 640x480 output1.jpeg \-\-scale 320x240 output2.jpeg
